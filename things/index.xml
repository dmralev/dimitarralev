      <description>Here we go, the game you now hate while playing, but love while not. The main source of nostalgia for millions of people, and one of the reasons I skipped writing a couple of posts here, because I was busy levelling and gearing my new Death Knight.</description>

      <description>I have a soft spot for people who try to preserve forgotten technology and old ways of doing things, so this post is about typewriter businesses, and I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about antic stores, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about legit typewriter selling and repairing places with 5 star reviews.</description>

      <description>Most of the times on YouTube you spot pretty quick if the content is thoroughly researched and tailored to the last detail. That was definitely the case when I stumbled on Every Frame a Painting a few years ago.</description>

      <description>This week I want to drop a huge thanks to the people who create the underground Hip-hop mixes on YouTube.
Hip-hop is probably one of the few music genres where you can pinpoint with a high precision where and when it started.</description>

      <description>I have seen a couple of videos from the off camera show a while ago while searching around YouTube (that black &amp;amp; white is something you never forget), but never actually decided to check other interviews from it.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t played No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky yet, mainly because I don&amp;rsquo;t have where, but if you are following game news at least at the basic level - you probably have heard of the hype around the release of No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky, the harsh criticism that it didn&amp;rsquo;t live up to its promised gameplay, and then its near heroic return, with a couple of really successful patches.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s issue is about the thing that made the most impact on my productivity in the last year.
Few months ago I had one of these days where I was in a mood to give chances to todo apps I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried yet (the list was shrinking).</description>

      <description>Here we go, issue 1.
I will probably sound like one of these cheesy TV shop commercials that want you to call in the next 5 minutes for a great deal, but hear me out. Chance is you&amp;rsquo;ve already seen this tool in the newsletters you follow.</description>
