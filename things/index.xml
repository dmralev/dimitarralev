      <description>I remember Bear was getting popular at the time that Evernote had its first massive pushback.
Someone at Evernote decided that people want more AI in their notes, which unsurprisingly turned out to be wrong and drove some people out of their platform.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm behind on most of the tv shows I followed before 2020. I don‚Äôt have the time and the will to focus on one at the moment. The same goes with discoveries. I haven‚Äôt discovered any new shows this year.</description>

      <description>I was clearing some links from the hundreds of articles that I have marked as ‚ÄúTo Read‚Äù. And Somewhere at the end of the marathon, I stumbled upon Facebook‚Äôs problems can be solved with design.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been having pretty much the same night routine in the last 3 months ‚Äî going out to skate with my longboard while listening to a podcast or an album (Beach House, mostly).
Doing this at the end of the summer was actually pretty fun.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve mentioned multiple times that I have problems finding what to listen to while working. Here‚Äôs my new addition to the topic ‚Äî 10 hour Minecraft ambience videos.
They were spoon-fed to me by the YouTube algorithm and I didn‚Äôt regret checking them out.</description>

      <description>I discovered this album almost randomly on Twitter(of all places) around the time it was released about 8 years ago. It‚Äôs one of those cases where to this day I‚Äôm still grateful that I checked an album recommendation from a tech journalist‚Äôs tweet because I doubt I would‚Äôve found Bloom from my usual channels.</description>

      <description>Getting up from the bed at the earliest hour possible is the pivot of all self-care articles ever written by the self-proclaimed life/productivity hackers on medium.
I have my share of periods of trying hard to get up at 7-8 in the morning, without hating it with every part of my body.</description>

      <description>Surprise surprise! Another week, another productivity thingy.
I&amp;rsquo;ve probably read about brain.fm in Engadget because I remember trying it at work for a while, without being that much impressed, although every time I listen to this wonderful track they&amp;rsquo;ve put for free on YouTube, I think about checking it again.</description>

      <description>I was a strong opponent to writing on paper, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a plethora of to-do apps, used an erasable &amp;ldquo;smart notebook&amp;rdquo;, bought a touch screen pen, there was even a time that I was worried that I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to fill legal documents right (that bad) but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I decided to buy myself a Fountain Pen as a gift (inspired from a subreddit about fountain pens) that I turned my mind around paper.</description>

      <description>Usually I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for podcasts, it&amp;rsquo;s not that I can&amp;rsquo;t find interesting ones, I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the habit of investing time in them I guess. But there&amp;rsquo;s one podcast that I just can&amp;rsquo;t stop following - The Changelog.</description>

      <description>Around 7 years ago when I was already deep down in the jungle of becoming a self-taught software engineer, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how, but I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled on checkio. At that time it had support only for Python (my first language).</description>

  Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been taking days off work for specific reasons, mostly traveling and concerts.
So, something strange happened in late July and August that caught me by surprise.</description>

      <description>It took me a few summers to decide, but I&amp;rsquo;ve finally bought myself a longboard üò≤
Aside from turning my legs into jelly the next day and making my other workouts harder, it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to cruise around and hype to a hip-hop bangers.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I&amp;rsquo;m able to explain this game.
It&amp;rsquo;s a battle-royal kind of game where you start with 59 other players and try to get to the finish line or not get knocked out of a platform.</description>

  Time has finally come for the second &amp;ldquo;thing of the week&amp;rdquo; about tooling.
Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve bookmarked various services which provide quality and free illustrations (perfect for side projects) and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until this month that I finally used one of them for a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.</description>

      <description>A nostalgic one.
I actually don&amp;rsquo;t remember what reminded me to search videos about Vice City, but for sure I&amp;rsquo;m thankful I did.
Probably everybody that played this game has memories of driving a car around while listening to the quality made radio stations.</description>

      <description>This is a video I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping for a long time because as a someone who rarely had any interest in school besides sports, it speaks deeply to me.
Of course, some of the ideas presented in the video are not a silver bullet for the perfect learning experience, but I like the mindset from which they are coming.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the main reason that I was late on so many things in the late summer. After a long chain of events, a massive protests erupted in Bulgaria, and for those who are far away from Eastern Europe - this is a huge deal.</description>

      <description>I have a soft spot for people who try to preserve forgotten technology and old ways of doing things, so this post is about typewriter businesses, and I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about antic stores, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about legit typewriter selling and repairing places with 5 star reviews.</description>

Hip-hop is probably one of the few music genres where you can pinpoint with a high precision where and when it started.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t played No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky yet, mainly because I don&amp;rsquo;t have where, but if you are following game news at least at the basic level - you probably have heard of the hype around the release of No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky, the harsh criticism that it didn&amp;rsquo;t live up to its promised gameplay, and then its near heroic return, with a couple of really successful patches.</description>
