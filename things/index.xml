      <description>Most of the times on YouTube you spot pretty quick if the content is thoroughly researched and tailored to the last detail. That was definitely the case when I stumbled on Every Frame a Picture a few years ago.</description>

      <description>This week I want to drop a huge thanks to the people who create the underground Hip-hop mixes on YouTube.
Hip-hop is probably one of the few music genres where you can pinpoint with a high precision where and when it started.</description>

      <description>I have seen a couple of videos from the off camera show a while ago while searching around YouTube (that black &amp;amp; white is something you never forget), but never actually decided to check other interviews from it.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t played No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky yet, mainly because I don&amp;rsquo;t have where, but if you are following game news at least at the basic level - you probably have heard of the hype around the release of No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky, the harsh criticism that it didn&amp;rsquo;t live up to its promised gameplay, and then its near heroic return, with a couple of really successful patches.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s issue is about the thing that made the most impact on my productivity in the last year.

      <description>Here we go, issue 1.
