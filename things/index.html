        <strong>“Thing of the week”</strong> is a journal like section where I write about something important from my week worthy enough to be shared.

              I love watching videos about open source engineers and their projects.
Often I will have one of these days where it’s plain hard to motivate myself to work on my projects, or some chore (especially if it’s not that interesting and it feels more like a boring chore).

              I’ve watched many of the binaural city walk around city X videos, but it wasn’t until this year’s pandemic that made me fully appreciate them.
If you are in lockdown, can’t travel, and feeling nostalgic about a place you miss — watching such videos can fill that void.

Someone at Evernote decided that people want more AI in their notes, which unsurprisingly turned out to be wrong and drove some people out of their platform.

              I’m behind on most of the tv shows I followed before 2020. I don’t have the time and the will to focus on one at the moment. The same goes with discoveries. I haven’t discovered any new shows this year.

              I’ve been having pretty much the same night routine in the last 3 months — going out to skate with my longboard while listening to a podcast or an album (Beach House, mostly).
Doing this at the end of the summer was actually pretty fun.

              I’ve mentioned multiple times that I have problems finding what to listen to while working. Here’s my new addition to the topic — 10 hour Minecraft ambience videos.
They were spoon-fed to me by the YouTube algorithm and I didn’t regret checking them out.

              I discovered this album almost randomly on Twitter(of all places) around the time it was released about 8 years ago. It’s one of those cases where to this day I’m still grateful that I checked an album recommendation from a tech journalist’s tweet because I doubt I would’ve found Bloom from my usual channels.

  Time has finally come for the second &ldquo;thing of the week&rdquo; about tooling.
Over the years I&rsquo;ve bookmarked various services which provide quality and free illustrations (perfect for side projects) and it wasn&rsquo;t until this month that I finally used one of them for a project I&rsquo;ve been working on.

              Most of the times on YouTube you spot pretty quick if the content is thoroughly researched and tailored to the last detail. That was definitely the case when I stumbled on Every Frame a Painting a few years ago.

              This week I want to drop a huge thanks to the people who create the underground Hip-hop mixes on YouTube.
Hip-hop is probably one of the few music genres where you can pinpoint with a high precision where and when it started.

              I have seen a couple of videos from the off camera show a while ago while searching around YouTube (that black &amp; white is something you never forget), but never actually decided to check other interviews from it.

              I haven&rsquo;t played No Man&rsquo;s Sky yet, mainly because I don&rsquo;t have where, but if you are following game news at least at the basic level - you probably have heard of the hype around the release of No Man&rsquo;s Sky, the harsh criticism that it didn&rsquo;t live up to its promised gameplay, and then its near heroic return, with a couple of really successful patches.

              This week&rsquo;s issue is about the thing that made the most impact on my productivity in the last year.
Few months ago I had one of these days where I was in a mood to give chances to todo apps I haven&rsquo;t tried yet (the list was shrinking).

              Here we go, issue 1.
I will probably sound like one of these cheesy TV shop commercials that want you to call in the next 5 minutes for a great deal, but hear me out. Chance is you&rsquo;ve already seen this tool in the newsletters you follow.
