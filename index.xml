      <description>I was a strong opponent to writing on paper, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a plethora of to-do apps, used an erasable &amp;ldquo;smart notebook&amp;rdquo;, bought a touch screen pen, there was even a time that I was worried that I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to fill legal documents right (that bad) but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I decided to buy myself a Fountain Pen as a gift (inspired from a subreddit about fountain pens) that I turned my mind around paper.</description>

      <description>Usually I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for podcasts, it&amp;rsquo;s not that I can&amp;rsquo;t find interesting ones, I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the habit of investing time in them I guess. But there&amp;rsquo;s one podcast that I just can&amp;rsquo;t stop following - The Changelog.</description>

      <description>Around 7 years ago when I was already deep down in the jungle of becoming a self-taught software engineer, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how, but I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled on checkio. At that time it had support only for Python (my first language).</description>

  Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been taking days off work for specific reasons, mostly traveling and concerts.
So, something strange happened in late July and August that caught me by surprise.</description>

      <description>It took me a few summers to decide, but I&amp;rsquo;ve finally bought myself a longboard 😲
Aside from turning my legs into jelly the next day and making my other workouts harder, it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to cruise around and hype to a hip-hop bangers.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I&amp;rsquo;m able to explain this game.
It&amp;rsquo;s a battle-royal kind of game where you start with 59 other players and try to get to the finish line or not get knocked out of a platform.</description>

  Time has finally come for the second &amp;ldquo;thing of the week&amp;rdquo; about tooling.
Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve bookmarked various services which provide quality and free illustrations (perfect for side projects) and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until this month that I finally used one of them for a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.</description>

      <description>A nostalgic one.
I actually don&amp;rsquo;t remember what reminded me to search videos about Vice City, but for sure I&amp;rsquo;m thankful I did.
Probably everybody that played this game has memories of driving a car around while listening to the quality made radio stations.</description>

  I&amp;rsquo;ve been working out three times a week for more 10 months now, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I moved to a stricter diet and daily workouts, that I found out how fun and important cheat reward days can be.</description>

      <description>This is a video I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping for a long time because as a someone who rarely had any interest in school besides sports, it speaks deeply to me.
Of course, some of the ideas presented in the video are not a silver bullet for the perfect learning experience, but I like the mindset from which they are coming.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the main reason that I was late on so many things in the late summer. After a long chain of events, a massive protests erupted in Bulgaria, and for those who are far away from Eastern Europe - this is a huge deal.</description>

      <description>Here we go, the game you now hate while playing, but love while not. The main source of nostalgia for millions of people, and one of the reasons I skipped writing a couple of posts here, because I was busy levelling and gearing my new Death Knight.</description>

      <description>I have a soft spot for people who try to preserve forgotten technology and old ways of doing things, so this post is about typewriter businesses, and I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about antic stores, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about legit typewriter selling and repairing places with 5 star reviews.</description>

      <description>Most of the times on YouTube you spot pretty quick if the content is thoroughly researched and tailored to the last detail. That was definitely the case when I stumbled on Every Frame a Painting a few years ago.</description>

      <description>This week I want to drop a huge thanks to the people who create the underground Hip-hop mixes on YouTube.
Hip-hop is probably one of the few music genres where you can pinpoint with a high precision where and when it started.</description>

      <description>I have seen a couple of videos from the off camera show a while ago while searching around YouTube (that black &amp;amp; white is something you never forget), but never actually decided to check other interviews from it.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t played No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky yet, mainly because I don&amp;rsquo;t have where, but if you are following game news at least at the basic level - you probably have heard of the hype around the release of No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky, the harsh criticism that it didn&amp;rsquo;t live up to its promised gameplay, and then its near heroic return, with a couple of really successful patches.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s issue is about the thing that made the most impact on my productivity in the last year.
Few months ago I had one of these days where I was in a mood to give chances to todo apps I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried yet (the list was shrinking).</description>

      <description>It’s probably hard to count how many services are out there on the internet, for the sole purpose of sharing interesting links (they will even reward you with some kind of cute virtual) and yet, I decided to start a weekly article series on doing the exact same thing, here…</description>

      <description>I remember that I first heard Warpaint early this year. I assume that I just followed some pitchfork link to their new single, maybe because I thought that their name is cool.
Sure, I hardly imagined that about year later - on 31st of December, I will be writing about them.</description>

      <description>Months before I started Tuesday(The WordPress theme), I was thinking about ideas for a serious project and most of the time the word that was coming to my mind was Bookmarking.
At this time, when I find something interesting on the internet, I had to open gmail and send the links to myself.</description>

      <description>Short personal story I remember the day very clear. Previous night I decided to get up early, go to Costa Coffee, and start the project. My plans were to finish it in one month, deadline that now sounds to me very optimistic, given the fact that I finished Tuesday in month and a half.</description>

      <description>After the release of the early Bookmarko version, I started to look around for the next idea that would be interesting to be made and also to help me learn some new developer tools. That&amp;rsquo;s why my approach was more &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this will work&amp;rdquo; than to make a full working app.</description>
