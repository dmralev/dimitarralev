      <description>Most of the times on YouTube you spot pretty quick if the content is thoroughly researched and tailored to the last detail. That was definitely the case when I stumbled on Every Frame a Picture a few years ago.</description>

      <description>This week I want to drop a huge thanks to the people who create the underground Hip-hop mixes on YouTube.
Hip-hop is probably one of the few music genres where you can pinpoint with a high precision where and when it started.</description>

      <description>I have seen a couple of videos from the off camera show a while ago while searching around YouTube (that black &amp;amp; white is something you never forget), but never actually decided to check other interviews from it.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t played No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky yet, mainly because I don&amp;rsquo;t have where, but if you are following game news at least at the basic level - you probably have heard of the hype around the release of No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky, the harsh criticism that it didn&amp;rsquo;t live up to its promised gameplay, and then its near heroic return, with a couple of really successful patches.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s issue is about the thing that made the most impact on my productivity in the last year.
Few months ago I had one of these days where I was in a mood to give chances to todo apps I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried yet (the list was shrinking).</description>

      <title>Starting a new “Things” series</title>

      <description>It’s probably hard to count how many services are out there on the internet, for the sole purpose of sharing interesting links (they will even reward you with some kind of cute virtual) and yet, I decided to start a weekly article series on doing the exact same thing, here…</description>

      <description>Here we go, issue 1.
I will probably sound like one of these cheesy TV shop commercials that want you to call in the next 5 minutes for a great deal, but hear me out. Chance is you&amp;rsquo;ve already seen this tool in the newsletters you follow.</description>

      <title>The spirit of 2014 - Warpaint</title>

      <description>I remember that I first heard Warpaint early this year. I assume that I just followed some pitchfork link to their new single, maybe because I thought that their name is cool.
Sure, I hardly imagined that about year later - on 31st of December, I will be writing about them.</description>

      <title>Bookmarko - Learning by doing</title>

      <description>Months before I started Tuesday(The WordPress theme), I was thinking about ideas for a serious project and most of the time the word that was coming to my mind was Bookmarking.
At this time, when I find something interesting on the internet, I had to open gmail and send the links to myself.</description>

      <title>On making Tuesday from the second try</title>

      <description>Short personal story I remember the day very clear. Previous night I decided to get up early, go to Costa Coffee, and start the project. My plans were to finish it in one month, deadline that now sounds to me very optimistic, given the fact that I finished Tuesday in month and a half.</description>

      <title>Simplexpenses - The battle of the frameworks</title>

      <description>After the release of the early Bookmarko version, I started to look around for the next idea that would be interesting to be made and also to help me learn some new developer tools. That&amp;rsquo;s why my approach was more &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this will work&amp;rdquo; than to make a full working app.</description>
