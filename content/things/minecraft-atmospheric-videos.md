[![Minecraft Rain on Leaves Ambience with Music to help sleep 10 Hours][image-1]][1]

I’ve mentioned multiple times that I have problems finding what to listen to while working. Here’s my new addition to the topic — 10 hour Minecraft ambience videos.

They were spoon-fed to me by the YouTube algorithm and I didn’t regret checking them out. The first one I stumbled on I think was [Indoor Snow Storm][2], I also like the [Indoor Snow][3] one. There are great [Rain][4] ones too, but my favourite is [Rain on Leaves][5] on which I’ve probably accumulated more than 15 hours by now. [There are a lot of them on this channel][6].

These videos not only help me study/work, but also remind me of a game I really like, but I’m not playing anymore, since losing my last hardcore world this summer.

They are a perfect combination of the in-game ambience and the unforgettable soundtrack by C418, and are well worth to be added to your study routine or “relaxing during the lockdown” playlist.
