[![Vue.js: The Documentary](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OrxmtDw4pVI/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxmtDw4pVI)

I love watching videos about open source engineers and their projects.

Often I will have one of these days where it’s plain hard to motivate myself to work on my projects, or some chore (especially if it’s not that interesting and it feels more like a boring chore).

Over time I’ve found that one thing that helps me get through such period is watching videos about open source contributors, their project, and what inspired them to create it. Watching them, most of the time, it gets me back to work pretty quick.

Recently I found the [honeypot.io](https://www.honeypot.io) YouTube channel, and I was instantly hooked up on their originals.

I highly recommend the [vue.js documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxmtDw4pVI) and the [GraphQL one as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=783ccP__No8). They also do great engineer profiles. Favourites are [that one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6tLIfPJm2w), [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifq3xhik8tE), and [that one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FewBQhbb5PU).
