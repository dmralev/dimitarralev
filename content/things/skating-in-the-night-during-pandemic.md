I’ve been having pretty much the same night routine in the last 3 months - going out to skate with my longboard while listening to a podcast or an album (Beach House, mostly).

Doing this at the end of the summer was actually pretty fun, the summer mood and generally the absence of bad things to obsess about was really enjoying.

Going into the winter though, there’s a huge difference for me. 

The feeling right now I can describe as calm, but uneasy.

It’s the cold air that hits you at the moment you leave(\<3), the thoughts about how much work I have left to do because I slacked in the summer, but mostly it’s the feeling of being unsure about how your next month is going to look like, the fear of losing control over your own plans.

I go out to skate just to enjoy that one hour of clean mind and feeling of freedom that skating gives you. Sadly, right now you can’t have even this, you are constantly reminded by passing ambulances that you are in a midst of a health crisis, they are like a window to a parallel world, where people on on first line risk their lives without much in return, and yours, where you are trying to enjoy yourself after a long day, although not that long as theirs. I often feel bad for ambulance drivers who see me passing by them on a skateboard, while they are going to their next address to check on another patient.

And this is not fiction or some creative writing, every night that I’m out, I have a game where I bet against myself if I’m going to see an ambulance passing me by. Until today I’m 4/4 losses, and the last time not only that I lost on the fourth minute, but I saw a total of 3 that night.
