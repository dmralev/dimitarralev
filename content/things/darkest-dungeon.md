Darkest Dungeon is an indie game I bought on a cyber Monday discount, after seeing in a couple of streams and reading how unforgiving it is (I’m an FTL veteran, I like such games).

It’s basically a rogue-like [Lovecraftian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovecraftian_horror) RPG. The main objective is to complete a dungeon run with a team of 4 different heroes, selected from a wide variety of available classes. To finish the dungeon, you have to manage various game mechanics like light, stress, and other important factors,  which can have a negative impact on your run if you are not careful.

it’s no surprise that one of the most famous quotes from the narrator (the main star of the game, aside from the mechanics) is the following:

> Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.

It Turned out the reviews were right and the game can be truly painful at times. You have to level your heroes, and if they die in a mission — it’s almost certain that they can’t be brought back. You have to grind a lot of missions, so you are well prepared for the bosses, and then to storm the final zone — the darkest dungeon.

I went into the game without preparation, no looking into the wiki for details that can help me with the bosses, or make the game easier in general, nothing. And although this made the run so much stressful (I didn’t want to spend days on this game), beating it that way was so much rewarding.
