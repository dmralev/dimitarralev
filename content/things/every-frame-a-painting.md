Most of the times on YouTube you spot pretty quick if the content is thoroughly researched and tailored to the last detail. That was definitely the case when I stumbled on Every Frame a Painting a few years ago.

If you, like me, enjoy analysis of the [tricks and creativity in producing quality visual storytelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q4X2vDRfRk), you'll for sure love [their video essays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ).

Even if you are casual movie fan, you'll probably enjoy the insights provided in their videos, like [why the Avengers franchise didn't had memorable music a few years back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vfqkvwW2fs).

Sadly the channel is not active anymore. You can read about their process and origin story [in their postmortem post](https://medium.com/@tonyszhou/postmortem-1b338537fabc).

p.s My favourites are [Geometry of a scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGc-K7giqKM) and [How to structure a video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GXv2C7vwX0).
