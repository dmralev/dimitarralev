[![Six problems with our school system](https://img.youtube.com/vi/okpg-lVWLbE/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okpg-lVWLbE)

This is a video I've been keeping for a long time because as a someone who rarely had any interest in school besides sports, it speaks deeply to me.

Of course, some of the ideas presented in the video are not a silver bullet for the perfect learning experience, but I like the mindset from which they are coming.

Here are the problems mentioned in the video:

- Industrial age values
- Lack of autonomy and control
- Inauthentic learning
- No room for passions and interests
- Differences in how we learn
- Lecturing

p.s Bonus points if you recognise the voice actor from somewhere else ;]
