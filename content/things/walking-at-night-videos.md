[![Walking Around AMSTERDAM City Centre at Night](https://img.youtube.com/vi/FhVchKRLqIY/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhVchKRLqIY)

I’ve watched many of the binaural city walk around city X videos, but it wasn’t until this year’s pandemic that made me fully appreciate them.

If you are in lockdown, can’t travel, and feeling nostalgic about a place you miss — watching such videos can fill that void.

I love walking around cities at night. My favourite night routine this week is to pop one of these videos in “Picture in Picture” mode, mix it with cool night hip-hop music, and enjoy them while doing something else in the background.

For those who know me, it’s unsurprising that I’m mostly [tuning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrsyxC6QzJE) on [walks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhVchKRLqIY) from [Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UcMqxplvSw). Other cities work equally well. I recommend walking around [Japan](https://youtu.be/MKyJdahuo-U) or [New York](https://youtu.be/21HKaqA1rpo).
