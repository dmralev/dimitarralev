[![The Last Typewriter Repairman](https://img.youtube.com/vi/H6c_TnkpKOw/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6c_TnkpKOw)

I have a soft spot for people who try to preserve forgotten technology and old ways of doing things, so this post is about typewriter businesses, and I'm not talking about antic stores, I'm talking about [legit typewriter selling and repairing places with 5 star reviews](https://www.yelp.com/biz/gramercy-typewriter-co-new-york).

I didn't even knew such places exist, [before reading this great piece on medium](https://medium.com/backchannel/the-last-of-the-typewriter-men-729f150c5083) about one of the such places out there. I guess that, worldwide there are no more than 10 or 20 of these left, so props to the people who still do repairs and keep the knowledge about this revolutionary tool.

I don't own or plan to own a typewriter, but being a subtle fan of a more tactile and mechanical tools, [I can definitely see the prospects of having one, even in 2020s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP0t2dKolJs).
