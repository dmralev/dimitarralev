Time has finally come for the second "thing of the week" about tooling.

Over the years I've bookmarked various services which provide quality and free illustrations (perfect for side projects) and it wasn't until this month that I finally used one of them for a project I've been working on.

There are probably more out there, but here are the ones I've tried so far:

[Blush](https://blush.design/) - *"Create, mix, and customise illustrations made by artists around the world."*

I imagine using this a lot for a blog posts that need such illustrations, also not exactly free as you need a paid plan to have access to all illustrations.

[humaaans](https://www.humaaans.com/) - *"Mix-&-match illustrations of people with a design library"*

Can also be used in blush, but you can take the library for a free or the price you want, only from this site.

[unDraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations) - *"Open-source illustrations for any idea you can imagine and create."*

Absolutely great for quick bootstrapping of side projects.

**Don't forget to pay it forward and always credit the artists if you are using their work for free!**
