![Longboard](/img/longboards.jpg)

It took me a few summers to decide, but I've finally bought myself a longboard ðŸ˜²

Aside from turning my legs into jelly the next day and making my other workouts harder, it's a great way to cruise around and hype to a hip-hop bangers.

So far I mostly use it as an extra workout in case I happen to need one for the day, although I've used it once to cover a few kilometre distance to a football game (and was 15 minutes late).

The summer here is a bit crowded, so I can't wait for the autumn to hit and be able to cruise in the middle of the day without being annoyed by the amount of people in the park.

For finale I just want to say how much I'm grateful that my city has at least the base minimal infrastructure to make me enjoy being on the board, you can't say this for other cities (looking at you Sofia).
