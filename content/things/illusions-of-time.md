Nostalgia would be a prevalent topic in these journal-like series, so this great video by Vsauce is unsurprisingly the thing of the week.

It’s a 30-minute masterpiece on how people perceive time.
Aside from constantly making you ask yourself “Am I really that old now” it presents research and terms to explain for example, why it seems that time goes faster as we age, and our own biases when we think about events that happened in the past.
